# Stremio_Account_Maker

This program is an automated Python script that utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to perform login and sign-up processes on the Stremio platform. Breaking down its functionality, the program simulates the process of logging
into your Stremio account by filling out your email and password in a login form, and potentially carries out the registration process if the account doesn't exist or is recognized as invalid.

In summary, the program executes the following steps:

Visits the Stremio login page.
Fills out the login credentials (email and password).
Checks for any error messages and proceeds with registration or login scenarios accordingly.
Closes the browser program upon completion of the process.
